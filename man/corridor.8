.SH "DESCRIPTION"
corridor allows only connections to Tor relays to pass through (no clearnet leaks!), but client computers are themselves responsible for torifying their own traffic\. In other words, it is a filtering gateway, not a proxying gateway\.
.
.P
You can think of it as a fail\-safe for your vanilla Tor Browser or Tails, for your beautiful scary experimental Qubes proxying schemes, etc\. Or invite the hood to use your WiFi without getting into trouble\.
.
.SH "corridor\-data"
Keep track of acceptable Tor relays\.
.
.P
corridor\-data script opens a Tor control connection and subscribes to NEWCONSENSUS events (announcements listing all public relays), unless you inform it of any bridges to use instead\.
