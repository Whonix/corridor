## SYNOPSIS

`corridor-data`

`corridor-init-forwarding`

`corridor-init-logged`

`corridor-init-snat`

`corridor-load-config`

`corridor-load-ipset`

`corridor-load-ipset-logged`

`corridor-load-ipset-relays`

`corridor-stop-forwarding`

`corridor-stop-snat`

## DESCRIPTION

corridor allows only connections to Tor relays to pass through (no clearnet
leaks!), but client computers are themselves responsible for torifying their
own traffic. In other words, it is a filtering gateway, not a proxying
gateway.

You can think of it as a fail-safe for your vanilla Tor Browser or Tails, for
your beautiful scary experimental Qubes proxying schemes, etc. Or invite the
hood to use your WiFi without getting into trouble.

## corridor-data

Keep track of acceptable Tor relays.

corridor-data script opens a Tor control connection and subscribes to
NEWCONSENSUS events (announcements listing all public relays), unless you
inform it of any bridges to use instead.

`corridor-data &`

## corridor-init-forwarding

Set up IP traffic forwarding.

`corridor-init-forwarding`

## corridor-init-snat

Set up Source NAT with iptables.

`corridor-init-snat`

## corridor-init-logged

Log attempted leaks from selected clients.
This command will block until corridor_relays gets populated!

`corridor-init-logged`

## corridor-load-config

Sanity test for the configuration folders. Also internally used by corridor.

`corridor-load-config`

## corridor-stop-forwarding
## corridor-stop-snat

## corridor-load-ipset
## corridor-load-ipset-logged
## corridor-load-ipset-relays

Internally used by corridor.
